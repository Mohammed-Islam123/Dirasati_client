# Active Context: Current Development Focus

## Current Task

**Creating a Modern Landing Page**

The current task involves replacing the simple placeholder Home component with a professional, modern landing page that:

1. Displays only for unauthenticated users
2. Shows key features of the Dirasati platform
3. Provides clear navigation to authentication pages
4. Uses the established blue + white color palette
5. Follows responsive design best practices

## Recent Changes

- Initial Home component was a placeholder with basic navigation
- The application structure and routing are in place
- Authentication system is implemented using JWT tokens

## Next Steps After Landing Page

1. Testing the landing page on different screen sizes
2. Ensuring proper navigation from landing page to auth pages
3. Verifying the authentication check works properly
4. Documentation of components created for the landing page
5. Potential future enhancements (animations, additional sections)
